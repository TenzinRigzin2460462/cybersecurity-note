## üîê **Project 1: Technical and Non-Technical VAPT Report Submission**

### **Project Scenario:**

You are employed as a Security Consultant by a mid-size enterprise that suspects a compromise within its internal network. Two critical systems‚Äîan **Ubuntu Server** and a legacy **Windows 7 Workstation**‚Äîare suspected to be vulnerable. Your role is to conduct a complete **Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Test (VAPT)** on both machines.

The client expects you to:

* Perform thorough reconnaissance
* Identify vulnerabilities and exploit them
* Gain system-level access (if possible)
* Provide both technical findings and executive-level recommendations

Deliverables include a **Technical Report** detailing tools used, methods, and exploitation steps, as well as a **Non-Technical Report** for the management, outlining risks, mitigations, and timelines.

---

### **To-Do List:**

1. **VM Network Identification**

   * Identify and verify the IP addresses of both Ubuntu and Windows 7 VMs in the test lab environment.

2. **Open Ports & Service Enumeration**

   * Perform TCP/UDP scans to identify open ports and their associated services on both systems.

3. **Vulnerability Discovery**

   * Analyze the identified services for known vulnerabilities using online databases (CVE, Exploit-DB, etc.).
   * Research credible sources and document valid exploitation methodologies.

4. **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**

   * Attempt RCE via any validated exploit, ensuring proper documentation and screenshots.
   * Highlight the method used to achieve command or shell access.

5. **Credential Identification**

   * Capture or crack any credentials (username\:password) encountered during the engagement.
   * Enumerate weak authentication mechanisms or default credentials.

6. **Reporting and Recommendations**

   * Document each vulnerability with technical evidence, risk rating, CVSS score, and screenshots.
   * Provide step-by-step mitigation guidance.
   * Summarize the attack timeline, effort invested per stage, and recommend future hardening strategies.

## üåê **Project 2: Web Application Vulnerability Assessment on `http://zero.webappsecurity.com/`**

### **Project Scenario:**

You‚Äôve been hired as an **Ethical Hacker** to assess the security posture of a demo financial web application hosted at `http://zero.webappsecurity.com/`. The application mimics online banking behavior and may expose sensitive data if not properly secured.

Your task is to conduct a structured **Web Application Vulnerability Assessment** and submit findings with verified vulnerabilities, risk impact, and mitigation strategies.

The client is particularly concerned about:

* Authentication bypass
* Data leakage
* Injection vulnerabilities
* Misconfigurations and client-side issues

---

### **To-Do List:**

1. **Reconnaissance**

   * Gather basic information about the target application (whois, DNS, HTTP headers, robots.txt, etc.).

2. **Information Gathering**

   * Map out the web application structure including directories, parameters, forms, and inputs.
   * Note down technologies used (server-side language, CMS, frontend frameworks, etc.).

3. **Port and Service Scanning**

   * Scan the hosting server to identify open ports and running services that may affect application behavior.

4. **Vulnerability Identification**

   * Assess the application for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (e.g., SQLi, XSS, CSRF, IDOR).
   * Use manual testing and OSINT to identify potential exploits and document references.

5. **Known Vulnerability Validation**

   * Cross-reference application components with known CVEs or misconfigurations.
   * Check online forums, exploit databases, and advisory portals for relevant PoCs.

6. **Mitigation and Effort Summary**

   * Provide clear mitigation steps per identified vulnerability.
   * Include a professional timeline that outlines each phase of testing and findings.
   * Prepare a concise risk analysis tailored for management review.
