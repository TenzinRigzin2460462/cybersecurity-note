## 🔍 What is Ethical Hacking?

**Ethical Hacking** involves legally breaking into computers and devices to test an organization’s defenses. It helps identify vulnerabilities and fix them before malicious hackers can exploit them.

> **Goal:** Strengthen security by simulating attacks under controlled conditions.

## ⚙️ Phases of Ethical Hacking

1. **Reconnaissance** – Gathering information about the target.
2. **Scanning** – Finding open ports and vulnerabilities.
3. **Gaining Access** – Exploiting the system to gain control.
4. **Maintaining Access** – Creating backdoors to stay connected.
5. **Clearing Tracks** – Erasing logs and avoiding detection.
6. **Reporting** – Documenting findings and suggesting fixes.

## ⚖️ Legal & Ethical Considerations

- Always get **written permission** before testing a system.
- Follow the **Computer Misuse Act (UK)** or **IT Act (India)** or local laws.
- Be professional and never exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain.

> **Reminder:** Hacking without permission is a CRIME.
