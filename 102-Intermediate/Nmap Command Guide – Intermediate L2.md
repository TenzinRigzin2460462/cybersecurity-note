## Targeting and Host Enumeration

### Scan a Specific IP Range or Subnet

```bash
nmap 192.168.1.0/24
```

Use to discover all hosts on a class C network.

### Load Targets from a File

```bash
nmap -iL targets.txt
```

Useful in automation or when reusing results from earlier discovery phases.

### Skip Hosts Listed in a File

```bash
nmap --exclude 192.168.1.100,192.168.1.200
```

Exclude specific hosts during broad subnet scans.

### Randomize Target Scan Order

```bash
nmap --randomize-hosts -iL targets.txt
```

Avoid pattern detection in enterprise environments.

### List Targets Without Scanning

```bash
nmap -sL 10.0.0.0/24
```

Validates input structure and DNS resolution pre-scan.

### Avoid Commonly Monitored Ports

```bash
nmap -p 1-65535 --exclude-ports 22,3389
```

Avoid triggering security alerts on critical services.

### Sequential Scan

```bash
nmap -r -p1-1000 10.10.10.10
```

Disables random port order to assist with pattern-based analysis.

### Quick Tuning

```bash
nmap -F -T4 192.168.1.1
```

Fast scan using default top 100 ports with aggressive timing.

```bash
nmap -sV 192.168.1.100
```

Used to determine service versions.

### Intense Version Probe

```bash
nmap -sV --version-intensity 9 192.168.1.100
```

Deep detection of evasive or lightly fingerprinted services.

### Light Version Scan

```bash
nmap -sV --version-light 192.168.0.10
```

Faster scans with less intrusive probing.

### Enable Service Guessing

```bash
nmap -sV --version-all 10.0.0.5
